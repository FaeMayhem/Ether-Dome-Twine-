# Ether Dome (Portfolio Sample)

This folder is ready for GitHub Pages.

## Files
- `index.html` — playable interactive narrative (typewriter + meters)
- `assets/img/` — portraits + dome engraving
- `assets/audio/` — add:
  - `main.mp3` (loop ambience/theme)
  - `sting.mp3` (ending sting)

## Notes
- Audio requires a user tap to begin on most mobile browsers.
- Meters fade in after the first decision in each branch.
- Wells uses a mechanics-driven Dome “bleed” overlay tied to Dissolution.
